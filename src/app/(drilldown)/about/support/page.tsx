          <i>Tech Influence Watch</i> is a project of{" "}

          , Molly White&rsquo;s independent newsletter on cryptocurrency,
          technology, and tech policy. The data here and the reporting in the
          newsletter are two parts of the same work: the newsletter&rsquo;s
          investigations into tech industry influence inform what gets tracked
          here, and <i>Tech Influence Watch</i> data powers and extends my
          reporting. If you&rsquo;ve found this data useful, there's a good
          chance the newsletter is worth your time too.
        </p>
        <p>
          This data is freely available and used by journalists, advocates, and
          policymakers working to hold the country&rsquo;s leaders and the tech
          industry accountable.

          Keeping it free, accurate, and independent costs time and money. I
          don't use paywalls, run ads, or accept industry funding. If you find
          this work valuable, the best way to support it is to subscribe to
          Citation Needed.
