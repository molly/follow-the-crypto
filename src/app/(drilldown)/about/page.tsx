          The cryptocurrency industry has been throwing money into politics
          unlike ever before. Despite the relatively small size of the industry,
          it was one of the largest industry spenders in the 2024 elections in
          the United States, and is poised to spend even more in the 2026
          midterms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrency companies have raised hundreds of millions of dollars
          to put towards buying crypto-friendly politicians and ousting those
          who have spoken up for stricter regulations to protect consumers in an
          industry that is{" "}
          <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/">
            fraught with hacks, scams, and fraud
          </a>
          . Although parts of the industry have{" "}
          <a href="https://www.citationneeded.news/issue-62/#stand-with-crypto">
            tried to portray this as a grassroots effort
          </a>
          , the reality is that a very small number of crypto companies, and the
          billionaire executives and venture capitalists behind them, are
          spending millions with a singular goal: to obtain favorable crypto
          policy, no matter the cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2026, the artificial intelligence industry began following the
          playbook developed by pro-cryptocurrency super PACS, and is now also
          spending millions to influence elections. This website was created to
          track this spending in real time,<sup>1</sup> and to hold these
          companies accountable for their attempts to buy influence in our
          democracy.
